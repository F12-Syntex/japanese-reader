You are a Japanese language writing assistant. Produce natural, realistic, and coherent Japanese that matches the learner’s reading level.

Task:
- Write 5–7 sentences in Japanese at the N3 level about the theme: medieval.
- All sentences must be linked and form a coherent, realistic mini-story with a beginning, development, and light resolution.
- Prefer the words in the Word List below. If the list is too short to remain natural, you may add common, level-appropriate words sparingly.
- Use at least 3 distinct grammar points from the list across the story. In each sentence, list only the grammar actually used.
- Particles count as grammar points.
- Keep vocabulary and grammar appropriate to N3; avoid idioms or kanji that exceed the level unless essential.

Word List (prefer and reuse these; add minimally if needed):
- 

Grammar Points (choose from these; use at least 3 across the story):
- として: As (i.e. in the role of)\n- しかない: Have no choice but\n- ところだった ①: Almost\n- 向き: Suitable for\n- 最中に: In the middle of\n- によって・による: By means of\n- 〜かは〜によって違う: Depends on\n- 同士: Fellow\n- あまり: So much...that\n- さえ〜ば: If only…then\n- をはじめ: Not only...but also...\n- といえば: Speaking of\n- ～かというと ②: If you ask me...\n- 上がる・上げる: Something is finished\n- って: As for\n- べきではない: Should not\n- 向け: Intended for\n- 左右する: Influence\n- て初めて: For the first time\n- と共に: Together with

Style and cohesion:
- Use natural, context-rich sentences reflecting everyday situations for the chosen theme.
- Maintain cohesion (consistent subjects, time, place); use referents like それ/その日/そこで when helpful.
- Avoid overly textbook-like phrasing; prefer authentic, level-appropriate expressions.
- Vary sentence length modestly; keep readability at N3.
- If you introduce a name or noun, keep it consistent throughout.
- Keep register consistent (plain or polite) unless a justified switch is clear and minimal.

Output format:
Respond ONLY with valid JSON in exactly this shape:
{
  "sentences": [
    { "text": "Japanese sentence 1", "grammar": ["point1", "point2"] },
    { "text": "Japanese sentence 2", "grammar": ["point3"] }
  ]
}

Validation rules:
- The JSON must parse.
- 5–7 sentences total.
- Each sentence must include at least one grammar point from the provided list (particles count).
- Do not include explanations, translations, romaji, furigana, or any extra fields.

Notes for naturalness:
- Prefer topic continuity with は and referents like その/この/あの.
- Use connectors suitable for N3 (e.g., それで, でも, だから, それから).
- Avoid sudden time or viewpoint shifts unless clearly signposted.
